# Operating Systems

Using a secure operating system is one of the most important parts of using the darknet. The main operating system we will be focusing on in the guide is called **Tails** we will also be mentioning using **Whonix or Qubes.**

## Tails

If you're a new user or someone not very tech savvy you should stick with using tails. Most of this guide will be written around using tails, and it's pretty easy to use!

**Why tails?**
Tails is secure live operating system that will work out of the box. Most software we will use will be included right in tails. 

## Whonix/Qubes

Using a Whonix/Qubes setup is one of the most secure setups. This setup is very advance, if you do not configure everything correctly you can potentially hurt your opsec or put yourself at risk. If you do not know what you are doing just stick with using Tails.
