# Origin Countries

The first rule is: stick to **domestic** whenever possible. Mail that does not cross any country border will get far less checked than all other mail. This reduces the risk of you not getting your package or even getting in legal trouble.

However one disadvantage is that the prices can be a bit higher compared to other listings from vendors that ship not from your country. You have to decide for yourself if you want to take the higher risk and pay a bit less or if you want to play it safe and pay a bit more.

If you buy for the first time or for one of the first times, it is best to stick to domestic even if you have to pay a bit more. Many new users worry too much during their first orders (e.g. get paranoid) or even make mistakes. In order to get yourself some peace of mind you should stick to domestic because it generally means a higher success chance.

## "Hot" Origin Countries


If you order international, it is strongly discouraged to order from the following "hot countries" because mail coming from these countries will usually get checked extensively.

- The Netherlands (NL) - notorious origin country for all drugs
- Colombia (CO) - notorious cocaine and heroin origin country
- Peru (PE) - notorious cocaine origin country
- Bolivia (BO) - notorious cocaine origin country
- Venezuela (VE) - significant but marginal cocaine origin country with possibly [rising market share](https://www.insightcrime.org/news/brief/explosion-cocaine-labs-venezuela-production-migration/)
- Ecuador (EC) - significant but marginal cocaine origin country
- Canada (CA) is on Israel's drug origin country watch list, and, specifically, XpressPost (express mail) from - Canada is often opened by US Customs indiscriminately. Note: Mail that is not XpressPost from Canada is usually not cause for extra concern.
- Spain (ES) is on Israel's drug origin country watch list. This affects imports into Israel.
- France (FR) is on Israel's drug origin country watch list. This affects imports into Israel.

Though their list may differ somewhat from global customs agencies including US Customs, the US State Department gives a decent idea about which countries they consider to be major sources of drugs. In their yearly [International Narcotics Control Strategy Report](https://www.state.gov/j/inl/rls/nrcrpt/index.htm), they give details about the following countries which they consider to be "Major Illicit Drug Producing, Drug-Transit, Significant Source, Precursor Chemical" countries. As of INCSR 2018 Volume 1, those are:

**Major Illicit Drug Producing, Drug-Transit, and Significant Source Countries**

**Major Illicit Drug Producing and Major Drug-Transit Countries**

A major illicit drug producing country is one in which:

A. 1,000 hectares or more of illicit opium poppy is cultivated or harvested during a year; B. 1,000 hectares or more of illicit coca is cultivated or harvested during a year; or C. 5,000 hectares or more of illicit cannabis is cultivated or harvested during a year, unless the President determines that such illicit cannabis production does not significantly affect the United States. [FAA ยง 481(e)(2)]

A major drug-transit country is one:

A. that is a significant direct source of illicit narcotic or psychotropic drugs or other controlled substances significantly affecting the United States; or B. through which are transported such drugs or substances. [FAA ยง 481(e)(5)]

The following major illicit drug producing and/or drug-transit countries were identified and notified to Congress by the President on September 13, 2017, consistent with section 706(1) of the Foreign Relations Authorization Act, Fiscal Year 2003 (Public Law 107-228):

Afghanistan, The Bahamas, Belize, Bolivia, Burma, Colombia, Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala, Haiti, Honduras, India, Jamaica, Laos, Mexico, Nicaragua, Pakistan, Panama, Peru, and Venezuela.

**Major Precursor Chemical Source Countries**

The following countries and jurisdictions have been identified to be major sources of precursor or essential chemicals used in the production of illicit narcotics:

Afghanistan, Argentina, Bangladesh, Belgium, Bolivia, Brazil, Burma, Canada, Chile, China, Colombia, Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Egypt, El Salvador, Germany, Guatemala, Honduras, India, Indonesia, Mexico, the Netherlands, Nigeria, Pakistan, Peru, Republic of Korea, Singapore, South Africa, Switzerland, Taiwan, Thailand, the United Kingdom, and Venezuela.

## Countries known for strict customs enforcement on inbound international mail

Certain countries are known for having particularly strict customs inspections on incoming mail. Ordering contraband via international mail to and from these countries is up to the buyer, but generally discouraged because of the elevated risk of detection and arrest. Notable countries:

- Australia (AU)
- New Zealand (NZ)
- Israel (IL) - don't order drugs to Israel from Canada, Spain, France or the Netherlands
- Norway (NO)
- Sweden (SE)
- Finland (FI)
- Singapore (SG) and many other Asian countries
- Most Middle Eastern countries

Also inform yourself if your country is part of some kind of organization or has trade deals with other countries that allows mail to get send more easily and gets less checked.
