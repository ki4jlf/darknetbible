# About

The DNM bible is only possible because a lot of awesome people dedicated countless hours of their free time to writing the tools you will use when following the guide. So please show your appreciation to them by making a donation to the Tor project, Tails and/or GnuPG once in a while. If you have money to buy drugs, you also have money to reward the people who make it possible for you to order drugs safely to your front door.


One last thing: if you notice some dead links or outdated information, please send a message to the mods on {{< subdread "/d/DarknetMarketsNoobs" >}}
