# Before you start

So you are about to read how to commit felonies and reduce the risk of getting caught. It is strongly recommended that anything that could be considered Darknet related you don't do on your normal operating system, or default browser. Keep your darknet activity as far away from your real identity as possible. For example your browser could store the visited sites in his history and somebody else sees it when using your computer. Or reddit sells the account data it has collected from you to other companies (e.g. for advertising purposes) and so others know that you are very interested in buying illegal drugs online. Reddit also tracks you across different sites and links your different identities (e.g. your facebook account) together so they might even get your real name at some point.

It is extremely easy to protect yourself so that nobody knows that you even know about DNMs. So please take a look at the following chapter and follow the advice on there. It would be a shame if something that trivial ends up getting you prosecuted, wouldn't it?

## About video tutorials

There are also video tutorials available but it is not recommended to use them. There are several reasons for that:

- You compromise your OpSec when watching them because youtube for example knows that you are interested in buying drugs online 

- They also miss a lot of crucial aspects that you need to know when buying.

- They are not cross checked by many community members like the DNM bible but just produced by one single person and then published.


tl;dr stick to the DNM bible and if you still have questions that are not solvable by googling, you can make a post on {{< subdread "/d/DarknetMarketsNoobs" >}}.
