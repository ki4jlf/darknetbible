# Storing secrets with KeePassXC 

KeePassXC is a password manager that helps you store usernames, passwords and other secrets so that you don't have to remember them. It comes with a built-in password generator that allows you to use strong and unique passwords for all your accounts, leading to a lower risk of your accounts getting compromised (by hackers or law enforcement). Your secrets are stored in an encrypted database file that can only be unlocked with a master password, this way you can access all your accounts by remembering a single password.

You should use KeePassXC to store:

* Login details to market accounts and forums
* Cryptocurrency seeds and wallet passwords
* Passwords for your PGP keys

To start the tool on Tails, go to "Applications" -> "Accessories" -> "KeePassXC".
