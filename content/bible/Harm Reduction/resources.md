**PsychonautWiki**  
http://psychonaut3z5aoz.onion/  

PsychonautWiki is a community-driven online encyclopedia that aims to document the emerging field of psychonautics in a comprehensive, scientifically-grounded manner. Our primary motivations include:
* documenting all aspects of psychonautic theory and practice (including meditation, lucid dreaming, psychoactive substance use, sensory deprivation, ritual, etc.) from an evidence-based, academic perspective

* providing accessible education, encouraging safe practices, and reforming cultural taboos around the responsible use of psychoactive substances, using both expert and crowd-sourcing methods

* promoting a culture of free thought and personal autonomy by safeguarding the information needed to make informed decisions over altering one's body and consciousness

**DrugWise**    
https://www.drugwise.org.uk/

As well as updating our drug information and writing new reports, we provide a full range of DrugScope archival materials and all Druglink articles back to 1986.

DrugWise also has an international dimension which is not restricted to drugs, but includes alcohol and tobacco where the advent of e-cigarettes is causing as much controversy as that surrounding the conflicting views on drug policy and practice.

There are many robust international and internationally-relevant national reports and reviews in all these areas. The problem is that they are not all in one place. So we have created I-Know, the international knowledge hub which will build up a library of information, policy and practice material stored on our server so that they will always be available.
