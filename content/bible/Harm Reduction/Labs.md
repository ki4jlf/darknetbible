**Energy Control International**    
https://energycontrol-international.org/

We are a group of like minded people regardless of whether we are drug users or not, concerned about the problems related to drug use in recreational settings and in society. We develop Harm Reduction strategies, offer information, personal advice and education regarding drugs in order to diminish risk and harm related to their use.

We offer a Drug Checking Service in order to inform the users about the composition of the drugs and therefore are in a position to advise them on less risky taking of said substance. We also offer customized, non-moralistic, and scientific drug information directed at drug users. The Drug Checking Service started operating in Spain from 1999 and since 2014 it is also offered as an International Drug Testing Service.

You can find reports from our International Drug Testing Service and links to our most relevant peer-reviewed scientific articles,  interventions in international congresses and other scientific forums, and conference posters.

**Wedinos**

Information from a range of sources in the UK and Europe indicate that some users of new psychoactive substances (NPS) are at risk of a number of serious adverse effects. Principally these include the direct or acute physical, psychological and behavioural effects following use, as well as the potential for increased engagement with criminal justice services. Longer term, or chronic effects are, in the main, poorly evidenced. This project is designed to inform both.

**Get Your Drugs Tested**   
https://getyourdrugstested.com/ (Canada)

We will test your street drugs and tell you what’s in them! 
GET YOUR DRUGS TESTED is the world’s largest repository of street drug analysis results. We are a community service offered entirely funded and operated by the Medicinal Cannabis Dispensary. We are certified by Vancouver Coastal Health as an Overdose Prevention Site but we receive no government funding and are independently run.

HOW THE TESTING WORKS

We have a special machine called an “FTIR Spectrometer” which can identify drug samples and tell us what they are.

The test takes less than five minutes and does not destroy the sample. The machine shines an infrared laser onto the sample, then analyzes the reflected light spectrum to identify the substances in the sample.

We also have test strips available, more specifically to test for even trace amounts of fentanyl or benzodiazepines.

We are currently offering drug testing nationwide through the mail, and in Vancouver samples can be dropped off for testing at 880 East Hastings during operating hours.
