# Crypto Closing Words

In short this is the path you will follow. XMR Wallet->XMR.to->Bitcoin wallet->Market

**Note**: After you convert make sure you use a new wallet that has not ever been tied to your identity. Wallets that send coins to markets can be labeled as “hot” you don’t want the two wallets to ever interact.

If you started with Bitcoin, and need to pay in bitcoin here is an example of the path you follow: BTC Exchange-> BTC Wallet 1 -> Convert to XMR -> XMR Wallet-> Pay for your goods. OR-> convert back to BTC-> BTC Wallet 2-> pay for your goods.
