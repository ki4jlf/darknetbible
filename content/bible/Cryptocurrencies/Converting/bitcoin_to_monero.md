# Bitcoin to Monero

Everything with Bitcoin can be viewed on the blockchain. If you started with Bitcoin that could be tied to your identity, or you want to convert your Bitcoin to Monero (recommended) start here.

How you bought your coins does not matter when you follow this path to break the chain to your identity:
For our example here we are going to use Elude. A list of of other exchanges can be found on {{< subdread "/d/Monero" >}}. Once you have done converting a few times you might want to try using a script. More info on using scripts can be found on {{< subdread "/d/Monero" >}}

## Elude

* Send your coins from your exchange to your private wallet. 

**NOTE:** Always keep “clean” coins in this wallet. This wallet should NEVER send coins directly to a market as it could be linked to you.

* Go to http://eludemaillhqfkh5.onion/exchange
* Click Exchange bitcoin to XMR.

* Enter the address that you would like your XMR coins to be sent to.
* Send your bitcoin to the address shown.
* Click check status of transfers, and make a note of the exchange status key.
* Wait for your XMR to arrive.
This is the path your coins just took: Exchange-> BTCWallet1-> Elude-> XMR wallet.
