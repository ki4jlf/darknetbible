# Converting

Converting in an important step you should always use to help keep coins from coming back to your real identity. As stated before you should always try to stick with XMR when possible. However some vendors or services do not accept XMR, in the case you can safely convert back to bitcoin and be on your way. For some it is just easier to buy bitcoin from an exchange with your real identity. We can break the chain so that these coins are no longer linked to your identity.

In this guide we are going to talk about using Elude. A list of other Exchangers is below.

If this is your first time converting, or you are not very comfortable changing coins in terminal you should stick to using Elude. Elude is a darknet service that is very active on dread. If you have any issues or questions you can easily get in touch with them on their subdread {{< subdread "/d/Elude" >}}
