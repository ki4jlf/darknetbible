# Monero to Bitcoin


Some vendors, or services do not accept Monero.
If this is the case you will need to convert your coins to Bitcoin. Again once you have converted a few times you might want to try using a script to convert. More about scripts can be found on {{< subdread "/d/Monero" >}}.

**Note:** This chapter used to be written around using XMR.to, they have decided to shutdown. This chapter will now focus on using Elude to also convert your coins back to bitcoin. You can use other services or scripts, but for simplicity we will focus on just using Elude.

## Elude

* Go to http://eludemaillhqfkh5.onion/exchange
* Click Exchange Monero to bitcoin.

* Enter the address that you would like your bitcoin to be sent to.
* On the next screen you will be given a XMR address to send your coins to. Make sure you send them from a wallet you control!
* Click check status of transfers, and make a note of the exchange status key.
* Wait for your bitcoin to arrive.

This is the path your coins just took: XMR Wallet-> Elude-> bitcoin wallet 2.
