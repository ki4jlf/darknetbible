# Monero (XMR)

Monero (XMR) is a decentralized cryptocurrency, meaning it is secure digital cash operated by a network of miners operated by users. Transactions are confirmed by distributed consensus and then immutably recorded on the blockchain. Third-parties do not need to be trusted to keep your Monero safe. These coins are much more difficult to trace. [This article](https://www.cryptoglobe.com/latest/2020/01/monero-xmr-transactions-cant-be-traced-says-europol-expert/) talks about how Europol has admitted they cannot be traced.
