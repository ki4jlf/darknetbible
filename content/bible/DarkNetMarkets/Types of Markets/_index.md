# Types of markets

Before we can jump in and pick what market you want to use it's important to understand the different types of markets you will or different some of the different payment methods you will come across. The three main ones are:

* Multisig
* Escrow
* Direct Deal

 Each market does things slightly different so even if you see they are an escrow market make sure you take the time to read their user guides. Typically these are found on the market homepage, or on their market specific subdread.
