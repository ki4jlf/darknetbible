# Choosing a Darknet Market

Choosing a market can be very overwhelming. More and more markets come out everyday. It is important to do your own homework about different markets, and vendors. Making constant posts on {{< subdread "/d/DarknetMarkets" >}} asking "Which market is the best right now?" will just leave you getting results from market shills or others trying to phish you. Instead you can check out the [Alternative SubDread List.](http://dreadytofatroptsdj6io7l3xptbet6onoyno2yv7jicoxknyazubrad.onion/d/DarkNetMarkets/wiki?id=3414404f) It has an entire section with market subdreads, start there and just read up about different markets, and other user experiences. Check frequently on market subdreads before you make an order. This will keep you up to date on any policy changes, or just keep you safer from exit scams.

Each market processes orders slightly different, make sure you check out market user guides that are usually right on their subdread.

## Where do I find links?

Make sure you NEVER accept links from people on forums, or sending you messages. Chances are they are just trying to phish you so they can steal your coins. The best place to get onions is directly from market staff. They will usually put their main onion address on heir subdread.


You can also get onions from trusted sources such as [DarkFail](dark.fail) or [DarkNetLive](http://darkzzx4avcsuofgfez5zq75cqc4mprjvfqywo45dfcaxrwqg6qrlfid.onion)

**Note:** Before you login or create an account on any market, make sure you **VERIFY** the onion address. More on that can be found in the coming chapter, [How to verify an onion address]({{< relref "Verify_onion" >}}) . 

## Finding Products

The other important part is finding a good vendor. You always want to stick with domestic orders when possible so finding a good vendor can take some time. To start you can make a post on {{< subdread "/d/DNMSourcing" >}} or the drug specific sub (For example {{< subdread "/d/LSD" >}} requesting others to let you know some of the vendors they have dealt with. You can also visit {{< subdread "/d/DNMAds" >}} to see if you can find a vendor there.

Once you have found a vendor you would like to deal with it's time to do some extra homework on them. For starters you can put their name into the dread search box, see if you can find anything on {{< subdread "/d/reviews" >}} about them. If everything seems to check out go on a market they vend on, and check recent feedback. If you still feel unsure about the vendor you may also make a vendor inquiry on {{< subdread "/d/Darknetmarkets" >}} 

More in depth tips for what to look for when selecting a vendor will be covered in the next chapter.
