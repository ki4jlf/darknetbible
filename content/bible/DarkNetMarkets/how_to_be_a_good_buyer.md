# How to be a good buyer

Being a good customer is just as important as selecting a good vendor. So here are some tips that will help along a smooth transaction.

- Always order sober. You will make mistakes if logging into a market while being high.

- Always read a vendors page completely before ordering. They may have special requirements to be met. Most questions for them can usually be answered this way.

- Be polite (to the vendor **and** market staff). This usually will take you further than expected.

- Do not wait for the last second or hour to dispute. Sometimes the market clock counts differently that you expect, so make sure to dispute at least half a day before the Auto-Finalize timer runs down. Also do not forget to contact the vendor first if you have issues with your order instead of disputing right away. Often they are interested in solving the problem without a dispute.

- If you are in a dispute: be calm and respectful. Explain your situation using just the facts available to you, no assumptions or accusations. Provide a desired outcome to your problem. Express willingness to compromise in situations where it is appropriate.

- When sending messages, use proper grammar and well structured sentences. Always encrypt your address properly yourself.

- After you make a purchase, log in within a day or two afterwards to make sure the vendor doesn't have a question or issue with your order. Keep checking until it says shipped.

- When you receive your package, finalize the order so the vendor gets their money. But **wait to give feedback until you have tested the product**. There is much feedback like "I'll update once tried" or something along the lines of that. You often can not update feedback once it is placed.

- Keep any chatter to a minimum and keep it short and sweet. Most vendors time are valuable to them.

- Be patient. Remember that this is not Amazon. Most vendors have a special way of getting packs out. A good rule for domestic orders is 7 days Tor-to-door. This is a very reasonable amount of time.

- **Never** ask for tracking unless a substantial amount of time has passed. And before asking for those tracking numbers, ask the vendor if they could give a heads up on the pack first.

- Don't double encrypt. That means encrypt your address using Tails and then paste that address into the message field on the market. Leave any checkbox that offers PGP encryption unchecked, otherwise the message would get encrypted twice which adds no necessary security boost and only annoys the vendor. To read why you should never let the market encrypt sensitive data for you please go to the [important tips for using markets chapter]({{< relref "important_tips" >}}).

- You do not need to include your public PGP key in the messages you send to the vendor since you already have it entered in your market account settings (if you have not done it yet, please do so **immediately**). If you still want to, you can include it at the bottom of your first message to that vendor (like "Here is my public key: \<public key here>") so he does not have to go to your profile to get your public key.

- Leave honest feedback and finalize the minute you get your pack and have assessed it's contents.

- Keep your PGP keys current on the market. That means if you key expired after a year, you should immediately replace it with the newly generated one in your settings on the market.

- Do not message a vendor before making an order and claim that you "usually move 10k pills a week but you are only ordering 150 from him to test them out to make sure they are legit" in hopes of getting some sort of deal or preferential treatment. Vendors get these messages all the time. They know that you are not some big player moving massive bulk, you are just someone hoping to get a discount by making a vendor want to land a "big fish" like you. Vendors get tons of messages every day and they notice buyers who are simple to work with. Eventually after a few seamless and easy orders, you can send them a PM telling them you like their service and ask them if they can get bulk orders bigger than what they list and what the prices they would be. Then they may start offering you better deals.

- The vendor does not need to know that you will be placing an order in a few days.

- If you agreed upon a special request, specific artwork, different stealth, modified shipping, etc with a vendor, put that same info in with your address. That way when the vendor is working on your order, it is right there in front of him again.

- Did you get too much or another product? Contact the vendor and tell him the situation. You will not be forced to send the product back or send the vendor some money, but the vendor knows that he made a mistake while packaging. Then he also does not have to wonder why the other customer is not receiving his order.
