# Frequently Asked Questions

## Why am I getting Javascript warnings?    
Read about why [here.](/bible/miscellaneous-information/javascript/)

## Can't I just use a burner phone instead of a secure OS?      
No. Cell phones are not secure at all. They have a lot of exploits in them. Go on craigslist/ebay whatever buy a laptop that is a few years old. It does not need to be anything special or expensive. 

## Do I really need to convert my coins if I'm only buying personal amounts?        
Yes! You wouldn't just hand a dealer drugs in front of LE in real life, don't do it here.

## What are the odds of (INSERT DRUG) getting seized? or my door getting kicked in?            
No one can give you a 100% answer on this. If you read through the entire bible you can greatly minimize your risk. If you select a vendor that has complete shit stealth, order from a hot country the odds will go up.
